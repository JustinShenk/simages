üêµ Similar image detection in Python üêµ

simages allows detecting similar images in an image folder or numpy array.

Description
-----------

Detect similar images (eg, duplicates) in an image folder. Behind the curtain, simages uses a PyTorch autoencoder to
train embeddings. The embeddings are compared with each other to create a distance matrix. The closest pairs of
images are then presented on screen.
