üêí Similar image detection in Python üêí

*simages* allows detecting similar images in an image folder or numpy array.

Description
-----------

Detect similar images (eg, duplicates) in an image folder. Behind the curtain, *simages* uses a PyTorch autoencoder to
train embeddings. The embeddings are compared with each other with `closely <https://github.com/justinshenk/closely>`_ to create a distance matrix. The closest pairs of
images are then presented on screen.
