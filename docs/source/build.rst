Building Embeddings
===================

Embeddings are extracted from the images by training a convolutional autoencoder.

The models available are listed in :mod:`~simages.models`.


.. automodule:: simages.models
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:

Extraction is performed by :class:`~simages.extractor.EmbeddingExtractor`:


.. autoclass:: simages.extractor.EmbeddingExtractor
